# TrailerPark2.0

### TrailerPark2.0 is a new and improved version of our first project for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp. This new version of Trailer Park utilizes React, MongoDB, Firebase Authentication, and the TMDB API. It looks very similar to the original version, but we've added the ability to favorite movies/tv shows, comment on them, like or dislike comments, and rate movies/tv shows.
